 <p1> To fully utilize face recognition technology in various facets like robotics it is essential to create architectures that can withstand uncertainties like ambiguous face representations, mismatched labels and invariant poses. Previously, researchers handled such problems during the pre-processing phase or by learning face features and uncertainties jointly. We propose an end-to-end architecture called Uncertainty Net (UNet), that learns data uncertainties during training phase and computes their corresponding attention weights.  These attention weights weigh each sample in the mini-batch at the decision layer of softmax-based metric to assess the quality of each sample. In addition, we introduce a relabelling mechanism, that rectifies problems pertaining to mismatched labels and multiple labels. Our approach alleviates overfitting of the model, on noisy low-quality face images, increasing the discriminative ability of the backbone model. Experiments on the standard face recognition benchmarks and our collected dataset prove the effectiveness of our method. Results on IJB-B, IJB-C, LFW, AgeDB30, CALFW, CFPFP, and CPLFW public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance</p1>

<p1>This is the real-time time implementation of EfficientNet used in 
UNet: Learning to Resolve Uncertainties for Large-Scale Face Recognition.
We have quantized the learned efficient net model and integrated into EdgeTPU devices. Due to limited pages, we could not cover the all the details of this work in the submitted paper. From a research model to real-world application, we have successfully  developed a deep learning based smart door lock which offers accurate wild face recognition, live streaming, CCTV recordings. We have further extended this work for adaptive face recognition using incremental learning in Edge Devices.</p>
