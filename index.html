 <p1> Facial recognition is a category of biometric security, used widely in various industries where we identify and authenticate an individual's identity using their face. In the modern deep learning era, face recognition datasets are playing a significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy by acquiring and training millions of face images. Annotating such a large-scale face recognition dataset is challenging due to low-quality face images, and incorrect annotations unknowingly caused by annotators. Training a deep learning model with such uncertainties leads to deep model overfitting on noisy uncertain samples, and degradation of discriminative ability of the model. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective uncertainty-net which efficiently reduces over-fitting caused by uncertain face images. More specifically, our module weights each sample in the mini-batch at decision layer, and relabeling mechanism carefully modify the labels of incorrect samples in the mini-batch. Results on IJB-B,IJB-C, AgeDB30, CALFW, CFPFF CFPFP, CPLFW, and VGG2FP public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p1>

<p1>This is the real-time time implementation of EfficientNet used in 
UNet: Learning to Resolve Uncertainties for Large-Scale Face Recognition.
We have quantized the learned efficient net model and integrated it into EdgeTPU devices. Due to limited pages, we could not cover all the details of this work in the submitted paper. From a research model to real-world application, we have successfully developed a deep learning-based smart door lock that offers accurate wild face recognition, live streaming, CCTV recordings. We have further extended this work for adaptive face recognition using incremental learning in Edge Devices.</p>
